# Auditorium-booking
This project is a full-featured Booking System built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js), available as both a responsive website and a mobile application. The system is designed to streamline the booking process for users and admins across multiple platforms with real-time synchronization and a user-friendly interface.
